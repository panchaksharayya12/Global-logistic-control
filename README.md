## Executive Platform Architecture and Core Capabilities

TRANSITIQ is an enterprise-grade autonomous Logistics Control Tower designed for modern global supply chain operations. It integrates real-time telemetry from ocean, air, road, and rail carriers into a centralized operational HUD to detect bottlenecks, predict late delivery risk, and execute corrective freight rerouting.

### 11 Integrated Operational Modules:
1. **Live Network Operations (`/network`)**: Real-time interactive tracking across 128 worldwide ports, air cargo hubs, and inland intermodal terminals.
2. **Delivery Performance Analytics (`/performance`)**: Granular scheduled vs. actual transit variance analysis, carrier SLA compliance scoring, and delay gap histograms.
3. **Delay Intelligence and ML Risk Modeling (`/delay-intelligence`)**: Root-cause diagnostic engine evaluating terminal dwell, customs inspection bottlenecks, and weather friction points.
4. **Multimodal Transport Benchmarking (`/shipping-modes`)**: Comparative speed, cost per ton-mile, and late risk matrices across Air Express, Rail Freight, Road Haulage, and Ocean Container lines.
5. **Regional Operations (`/regions`)**: In-depth corridor analytics, including dedicated operational views for key hubs such as Spain (Port of Valencia, Madrid Hub), Germany, France, and East Asia.
6. **Shipment Explorer (`/shipments`)**: Granular consignment search, live status filters, risk scoring, and route inspection.
7. **Customer and Product Intelligence (`/customers-products`)**: Financial impact analysis, sales per customer segment, and shipment risk correlation.
8. **What-If Scenario Simulator (`/simulator`)**: Monte Carlo simulation engine testing modal shifts, buffer time adjustments, and port bypass corridors.
9. **Action Center (`/actions`)**: Task management and automated workflow dispatching for flagged delays.
10. **TransitAI Operational Copilot**: Conversational assistant delivering real-time shipment telemetry lookups, corridor diagnostics, and strategic mitigation advice.
11. **Enterprise Report Center (`/reports`)**: Audit-ready CSV/JSON exports and one-click direct access to official academic publications and presentation decks.

## Backend Integration (Supabase)

The platform is configured with an enterprise PostgreSQL backend via Supabase:
- **Database Schema**: Located in [`supabase/schema.sql`](./supabase/schema.sql).
- **Core Tables**: `shipments`, `trade_routes`, `network_nodes`, `what_if_simulations`.
- **Client Configuration**: [`src/services/supabaseClient.ts`](./src/services/supabaseClient.ts) with local fallback for offline resilience.
- **Environment Variables**: See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

---

## Cloud Deployment (Vercel)

The application is configured for deployment on Vercel:
- **Routing Configuration**: [`vercel.json`](./vercel.json) provides SPA fallback rewrites for seamless client-side routing.
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
